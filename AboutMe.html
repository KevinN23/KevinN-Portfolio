		<h2><span>Everything</span> will fall into place</h2>
	    <p>Everything certainly does fall into place when you keep at it and work towards those goals relentlessly.
		   My journey to become a web developer has certainly not been the easiest. 
		   There has been times where I felt like giving up just throwing in the towel but 
		   giving up or quitting is when you truly fail.
		   So this was not an option, I kept at it just studying and coding on my ancient HP Pavillion dv6000.
		   For those whom do not know this model of my laptop, I will just say I purchased this brand new in 2008 and
		   we are now in 2017.  But hey it still works, has been dropped many times the sound no longer functions it is 
		   fairly slow but it does not quit on me!.  Which brings me to my work and my work ethics, I will keep at it
		   until I perfect it and I will not quit until I am satisfied with my work.  It has been many long nights over 
		   months that has brought me to this point in becoming a Full Stack developer whom has a passion for coding.
		   My background in education consists of database development (diploma), HTML5, CSS, Java, Javascript, PHP, Ruby, 
		   Jquery and AngularJS.  Thank you for visiting and reading, if you like my work or have questions please drop me
		   a line.</p>
